//! Dannesk's core: everything under the user interface, shared by the desktop
//! app and Android. The one socket to the proxy and what its frames mean
//! (`ws`), the state bus an interface subscribes to (`channel`), wallet
//! creation, import, sending, signing and storage (`bridge`, `wallet`,
//! `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `secure`), the launch-PIN gate (`gate`) and the
//! chain-neutral helpers in `utils`.
//!
//! An app calls [`init`] once, before anything else, and names what the core
//! cannot know on its own: its version and the directory its files live in.
//! Everything platform-shaped stays in the app: the window or the Activity,
//! fonts, the clipboard, and where that directory is.
