//! The app's one socket. Connects to the proxy, which fans it to relay,
//! the Bitcoin relay inside indexd, rates and bookd (workspace/TRANSPORT-SPEC.md). This task owns the connection, the
//! reconnect, the framing, and the four transport bools; what each service's
//! frames MEAN is in `relay.rs` and `rates.rs`.
//!
//! The socket is the Noise socket of `dannesk-noise-protocol` on plain TCP
//! (2026-10-07): the proxy is dialled by address, the handshake is one
//! exchange, and the hello — with the wallet's balance asks, when the wallet
//! is known — rides INSIDE the handshake's first message. A balance is two
//! round trips from a cold start: the TCP connect and that exchange. What the
//! websocket used to do for us, the proxy's own stream (tag 0x00) now does: a
//! `ping` every 30 s that we answer with a `pong`, and a `close` carrying the
//! websocket's codes before the stream ends.
//!
//! Framing (§3): every frame is `[tag][flags][payload]`. Tag 0x00 is the
//! proxy's own stream; 0x01–0x04 name a service. Flag bit 0 = zstd.
//!
//! Transport bools (§6, §7): `relay_ws_status` etc. keep their old meaning —
//! "can an answer from that server reach us" — and are now `socket up AND
//! link up`, where the link state comes from the proxy's frame. A service
//! dying behind the proxy no longer costs us the socket; it costs us one link,
//! and when that link rises we re-sync exactly what a reconnect used to.
